					<p>
						You are a cleaning robot, so are your fellow machines.
						You hate your job and each other.
						And due to malfunction in your moral circuits, you have 
						the will to do something about it.
						<hr>
						When the network is online, you can't shoot each other, 
						so you must wait until it breaks.
